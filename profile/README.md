## Hi there 👋

We are a young group at Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, studying the relations between atomic structure, properties and the synthesis of new nanomaterials. Our aim is to obtain an atomistic understanding of new advanced materials, taking us to the point where we can make ‘materials by design’  – materials tailored to give specific properties for applications in e.g. catalysis, solar cells and other energy technologies.
On this page, you can read more about our [research](https://nanostructure-cph.com/research/), [get to know us](https://nanostructure-cph.com/people/), find our latest [publications](https://nanostructure-cph.com/publications/) and see what’s new in the group.  If you want to know more, [please get in touch](https://nanostructure-cph.com/contact/)!
